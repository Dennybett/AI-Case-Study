### P**A**TIENT CONSULTAT**I**ON



**Background**

Some people believe the practice of medicine began in 460 BC when Hippocrates, the person widely credited as being the father of modern medicine, was born. Others argue it was around 3000 BC during the ancient Egyptian civilization when ‘doctors’ produced a written work chronicling over 200 medical conditions. No matter your stance on the genesis of medicine, everything else in the field of healthcare  has changed bar one thing; patient consultation. No matter which era you are from, the common denominator is that the patient, or their representative, presents the medical professional with the medical condition, who will then use their expertise in the field to provide the solution to the condition.

The problem with this is that while everything else in healthcare has improved, we have carried the risks associated with patient consultation throughout the centuries. Among the risks include late or incomprehensive consultation, errors and mistakes from both parties, and work burden on the medical professionals who would have to see ten of thousands of patients throughout their careers. On top of that, A research in the UK by the British Heart Foundation found that 20% of cardiac arrests occur in public places and 80% at home. It also said cardiovascular diseases cause more than a quarter of all deaths in the country. In the US, 350,000 people have cardiac arrests outside of hospitals each year: 90% of them die.This is the answer to “Why Corti?”.



**Origin and overview**

Corti, a company that ingeniously borrowed its name from the organ in the inner ear that helps with hearing, is the developer of a voice-based artificial intelligence platform designed for analyzing patient interviews. It listens in, takes notes, provides medical codes, and quality checks the interaction between patient and caregiver in real-time. 

Corti was founded in 2016 by Lars Maaløe and Andreas Cleve in collaboration with Copenhagen Emergency Medical Services in Denmark, with its headquarters in Copenhagen, Denmark. Desiring to leverage artificial intelligence to assist emergency dispatchers in identifying potential cardiac arrests, during phone calls, Corti AI analyzes the caller’s key words, pronunciation, voice tones and breathing patterns to detect critical situations in real time. This helps to narrow down to the emergency allowing faster response and potentially life-saving intervention.



**Funding and Results**

Since mid 2018 to date, Corti AI has already raised over $86 million. Notable investors include Prosus Ventures, Atomico, Eurazeo, EIFO and Augustinus Foundation. This has been instrumental in aiding healthcare professionals over 150,000 times daily across Europe and the United States. This has in turn helped cover some 100 million patients yearly across just the two continents. This team up has seen best-in-class health care administration, fewer errors, less red tape, and better workflow, emphasizing the words of its co-founder “For years, we’ve been proving that when humans and AI team up, the patient wins”

A research conducted by University of Wisconsin and American Medical Association to assess time allocated by primary care physicians within the electronic health record (EHR) showed that clinicians spent 5.9 hours of an 11.4-hour workday in the EHR per week. 68% of this time was directed towards clerical and administrative tasks and inbox management which could be delegated thus reducing workload, improving professional satisfaction, and decreasing burnout. Recommendations proposed in pursuit of “joy in practice” are proactive planned care, team-based care, sharing clerical tasks, verbal communications and shared inbox work. All of these are fields able to be addressed by Corti AI



**Technology used, innovations and trends**

The idea of artificial intelligence has been around since the 1950s but with the current cutting technology, we have been able to utilize it in the world of healthcare. To date, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved over 900 AI and machine learning-enabled medical devices in the USA. AI is going to play an even bigger role according to Jim Swanson, executive vice chairman and chief information officer at Johnson & Johnson.

Among the various ways AI is used to advance healthcare is through analyzing the operating room for efficiency and physician learning; improving surgical procedures; speeding up the process of discovering new medicines; enabling more targeted clinical trial recruitment; enabling more personalized care and enabling treatment to reach patients faster.

Corti AI utilizes advanced technologies such as Kubernetes; an open-source platform that automates the management, scaling, monitoring, changing, and deployment of containerized applications by grouping data into logical units using built in commands, and Docker, also an open-source platform for developing, testing and running applications, and Google Ads in its platform, showcasing its commitment to innovation and efficiency.

Corti’s AI-powered Co-Pilot offer has been trained on millions of patient interactions and acts as a second set of eyes, ears, and hands. In addition to providing a nudge as to when to deliver what care, Corti also provides journaling, coding, and QA services.This emphasizes the technological advantages of Corti's solution and its appeal to tech-savvy clients looking for cutting-edge AI tools. 

Corti sits comfortably among noteworthy pioneer companies such as PathAI, SophiaGenetics, and PAIGE. All these companies have integrated artificial intelligence into healthcare with noteworthy results, yet none of them have made a bigger impact in terms of addressing the criticality of a medical situation compared to Corti AI
 


**Recommendations**

As with everything, there is always room for improvement, and it will surely only be a matter of time before Corti AI won’t need to be the listener in the caregiver-patient conversation but the caregiver. This would be the next step in this life changing interaction between humans and AI. Corti AI should look into taking the complete role of the caregiver in the interaction, be able to dispatch an ambulance while giving the emergency medical team the diagnosis of the patient in question. This would save critical minutes which could be the difference between life and death.

As previously mentioned, AI could also be extended to the physician’s office to act as their personal assistant. It could be utilized to perform roles such as diagnosing medical images and assessing lab results. With the necessary consents, it could also be utilized in the treatment rooms to ‘listen’ and gather data that will allow it to diagnose medical conditions, propose treatment plans or even perform necessary medical procedures. With doctors already utilizing robotics to perform medical procedures, the next step would be eradicating the risk that comes with burnt out care providers.
